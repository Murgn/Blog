I'm a university student studying game development, travelling across the internet and tinkering with weird things along the way. 

My passion for development began in 2014, coding simple Minecraft mods in Java, then attempting and failing at creating "games" in Unity and C# up until 2018, where I moved onto creating several Discord bots in Python providing service to over 20,000 users. After experimenting with Python it felt like something had clicked and in 2020 I found my way back to game development, breaking free from the tutorial phase. 

Towards the end of 2022, up until the end of 2024, I began teaching after school clubs at various locations across my local area, exploring fun subjects and sharing what I know about animation tools[^1], scratch, programming languages and robotics.

Usually I'd flood the rest of this page with some lorem ipsum, but have a dolphin gif instead :)

oops, the page needs some more padding
